This program works with two data signals: EMG signal and
Force signal. It filters them, crops them, normalizes them.
The program, then, identifies equal segments of the data 
and calculates the average segment. Lastly, it plots the 
relation graph of this two averages and finds the best fit 
function for the period of contraction.
